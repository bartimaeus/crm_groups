=== Setting Up The Database

Fat Free CRM supports MySQL and SQLite databases. The source code comes with
two sample database configuration files: +config+/+database+.+mysql+.+yml+
for MySQL and +config+/+database+.+sqlite+.+yml+ for SQLite. Based on your choice
of the database create the actual database configuration file, for example:

   $ cp config/database.mysql.yml config/database.yml

Edit config/database.yml and specify database names and authentication
details. Once you have database configuration file ready run rake to create
the database:

   $ rake db:create


=== Setting Up The Application

The next step is to load default Fat Free CRM settings, such as menu structures,
default colors, etc. and create the Admin user. This is done by running the
following rake task:

   $ rake crm:setup


=== Loading Demo Data

You can test drive Fat Free CRM by loading sample records that are generated
on the fly mimic the actual use. IMPORTANT: loading demo will delete all the
existing data.

   $ rake crm:demo:load

Among other things the demo generator creates 8 sample user records with the
following usernames: +aaron+, +ben+, +cindy+, +dan+, +elizabeth+, +frank+, +george+,
and +heather+. You can log in with any of these names using the name as password.
The demo site at http://demo.fatfreecrm.com provides access as a sample user as well.

You can reset the database and reload demo data at any time by using:

   $ rake crm:demo:reload


=== Running The App

Now you should be able to launch the Rails server and point your web browser
to http://localhost:3000

   $ ruby script/server

When deploying with Phusion Passenger, also install Rack 1.0.1:

   $ gem install rack -v 1.0.1


=== For Developers

Fat Free CRM can be customized by implementing callback hooks and extended by
creating Rails Engines plugins. Check out these sample repositories demonstrating
the concepts:
