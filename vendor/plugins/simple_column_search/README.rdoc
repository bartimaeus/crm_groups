= Simple Column Search

Quick and dirty multi column LIKE searches. Great for prototyping auto-completers as it handles partial matches and adding search terms refines the results.

Running lots of queries or have a large data set? You should probably upgrade to a real search back-end already!

== Examples

Add a search method to your model by calling simple_column_search with the fields you want to search.

  class User
    simple_column_search :first_name, :last_name
  end
 
Search for a single value across all searched columns.

  User.search('eli')             # => anyone with first or last name starting with eli
  User.search('miller')          # => anyone with first or last name starting with miller
  
Refine the search by adding another search term.

  User.search('eli miller')
    # => anyone with first or last name starting with eli AND
    #    anyone with first or last name starting with miller

== Install

As a Rails plugin.

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/jqr/simple_column_search.git
